Q1. 
Line "case_long_iso_time_style" is just a label for "goto" command. Maybe Brady removes it to reduce the chance back to this label and thus not to do the execute statement.
But I think it is not necessary to remove this line because it actually doesn't influence anything, it is just a label. Even if it is removed, the "case" and the execute statement are still here.

Q2.
If there's no translation function, I think the patched version may cause confusion in countries where users don't understand English. Meanwhile, there may exist some situations under which users need the "2009-03-02 06:22" version, maybe for data collection. So changing to the traditional Unix format without flexibility may cause problems.

Q3. 
When the script is invoked on an empty file, it invokes some empty lines rather than error.

Q4. 
When I run randline.py.2 with Python3, it shows the following error:
  File "randline.py.2", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
It is because there is some different standard between Python3 and Python2. In Python3, the correct way of output IOError is:
except OSError as err:
       parser.error("OS error: {0}".format(err))
