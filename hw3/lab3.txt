step1: grab Coreutils 7.6
use wget command to grab
"wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz"

step2: compile and install
1) decompress the .tar.gz file
"tar -zxvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz"
2) compile and install
"cd coreutils-7.6" (get into the folder)
"./configure --prefix=/u/ee/grad/kaiyi/lab3" (executing configure file to check the environment and set the install path)
"make" (compile)
"make install" (install)

step3: reproduce the bug on my machine
1) change the locale setting
"export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'"
2) get into the directory ../lab3/bin and check if the bug exist
"./ls -l /bin/bash"
it shows: -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 960392 2016-07-12 08:17 /bin/bash

step4: apply Brady's patch
1) copy and paste Brady's patch to a file named patch.diff, change the path in first few lines to ./coreutils-7.6/src/ls.c 
2) apply the patch file to change ls.c
"patch -p1 < patch.diff" 
when asked file to patch: 
"./ls.c"
then both hunks succeed.

step5: compile the patched version
back to ~/coreutils-7.6 directory, and "make" to compile the patched version

step6: test
1) in ~/coreutilis-7.6 directory, check if the patched ls command succeeds
"./src/ls -l /bin/bash"
it shows: -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 960392 Jul 12 08:17 /bin/bash
2) in ~/lab3 directory, check the difference between the old ls command and patched one
"./bin/ls -l /bin/bash"
it shows: -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 960392 2016-07-12 08:17 /bin/bash
3) using "touch" command to artficially mark file assign2.txt as being a year old
"touch -t 201505181259 assign2.txt"
4) unchanged ls command
"./lab3/bin/ls -l ./assign2.txt"
it shows: -rw-r--r-- 2 kaiyi usbmuxd 8668 2015-05-18 12:59 ./assign2.txt
5) fixed ls command
"./coreutils-7.6/src/ls -l ./assign2.txt"
it shows: -rw-r--r-- 2 kaiyi usbmuxd 8668 May 18 2015 ./assign2.txt
