Homework

2. "git checkout v3.0 -b quote"
Switched to a new branch 'quote'

3. install my change into this new branch
"patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt"
it shows:
"patching file src/cmp.c
Reversed (or previously applied) patch detected!  Assume -R? [n]"
So I get another copy of Diffutils repository and apply my patch into it, it shows:
"patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c"
It means the patching is successful.

5. use function add-change-log-entry-other-window 
Being in src directory, I use "emacs cmp.c" to get into cmp.c file, and then use "C-x 4 a" to compose an ChangeLog entry. Since the guide says "by adapting the change log from the original patch", I don't type anything.

6. commit my changes to the new branch
"git add ." (pay attention to the space between add and dot)
"git commit -F ChangeLog"
it shows:
[quote db49138] 2016-10-20  Kaiyi Wu  <kaiyi@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu>
 Committer: Kaiyi Wu <kaiyi@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu>

 6 files changed, 44 insertions(+), 44 deletions(-)

7. generate a patch file
"git format-patch -1 --stdout > ../formatted-patch.txt"

8. verify my partner's patch
partner's name: Yu Zhong
partner's UID: 704291704
1) "git checkout v3.0 -b partner"
it shows:
Switched to a new branch 'partner'
2) " git am < zy-formatted-patch.txt"
it shows:
Applying: 2016-10-20 Yu Zhong <classrty@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu>
3) then I apply my partner's patch
"./bootstrap"
"patch -p0 < addpatch"
"./configure"
"make"
"make check"
4) then I run "diff . -"
it shows (with right quote):
diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory
I run "diff --help"
it also shows right quotes

9. verify my ChangeLog entry
"make distdir"
"cd diffutils-3.0.1-e875/" to enter the new folder
"cat ChangeLog" and it shows:
 2016-10-20 Yu Zhong <classrty@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu>
                * util.c: Changed all ` to '

                * sdiff.c: Changed all ` to '

                * dir.c: Changed all ` to '

                * diff3.c: Changed all ` to '

                * diff.c: Changed all ` to '

                * cmp.c: Changed all ` to '
So my ChangeLog entry works.

10. gitk
failed in doing this task in Windows, I finish this part in Mac:
"ssh -X kaiyi@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu" to connect to server
"cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs" to get into the directory
then run "gitk"
I find the newest merge not newer than 2015-01-25 and take a screenshot.
