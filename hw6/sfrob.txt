homework6:
1. After I successfully rewrite sfrob program, I compile two programs.
"gcc -std=c99 -o sfrobu sfrobu.c"
"gcc -std=c99 -o sfrob sfrob.c"
All succeed.

2. modify a little in bigfile.c and use it to generate a big txt file with space.

3.compare two programs
1) sfrob with getchar() and putchar(): buffered
time ./sfrob < bigfile2.txt > sfrobresult.txt

real    0m2.514s
user    0m2.393s
sys     0m0.037s


2) sfrobu with read() and write(): unbuffered
time ./sfrobu < bigfile2.txt > sfroburesult.txt

comparison number is: 104346285
real    0m15.071s
user    0m2.835s
sys     0m12.151s

4. shell script
#! /bin/bash
tr "wkyzqxhahafrswmlxixi" "frswmlxixiwkyzqxhaha" | sort | tr "frswmlxixiwkyzqxhaha" "wkyzqxhahafrswmlxixi"

time ./sfrobs < bigfile2.txt > sfrobs.txt

real    0m0.126s
user    0m0.019s
sys     0m0.039s

From the three results above (with same input file bigfile2.txt), we can see that sfrobs is fastest and sfrobu is slowest.
